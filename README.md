# Orthogonal-Procrustes-Problem-with-SVD
Code for aligning two hand shapes using SVD and the Orthogonal Procrustes Problem. Computes an optimal rotation matrix and plots the shapes before and after alignment.

handplotting.py takes the data set hand1.dat and hand2.dat to plot hand shapes. The script connects consecutive points from the data set and turns them into line segments.
