# Orthogonal-Procrustes-Problem-with-SVD
Code for aligning two hand shapes using SVD and the Orthogonal Procrustes Problem. Computes an optimal rotation matrix and plots the shapes before and after alignment.

Orthogonal-Procrustes.py performs orthogonal Procrustes analysis on two hand shape datasets, hand1.dat and hand2.dat. The script uses the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to calculate the optimal rotation matrix, which is then applied to hand2 to align it with hand1. The Procrustes algorithm is a widely-used method for aligning datasets in machine learning and data analysis. This script visualizes the original hand shapes and the rotated hand shape to provide a visual representation of the alignment. The output is the optimal rotation angle in degrees.
